# Desi-Spice (In Progress)
(In Progress)
This is just a simple static website for an Indian restaurant which was given as an assignment for a web development module at university. 
I do plan on making a dynamic version of this website which will introduce a booking system. In terms of the back-end technologies, I plan on using Node.js and SQLite.
